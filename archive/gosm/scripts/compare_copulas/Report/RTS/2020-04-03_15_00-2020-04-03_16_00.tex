    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 273 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2020-04-03:15:00, 2020-04-03:16:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 229 observations beginning 2020-01-01. The marginals were fit using an average of 92 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was WIND\_forecasts\_actuals.csv.}
