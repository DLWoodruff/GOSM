    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 211 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2016-10-11:20:00, 2016-10-11:21:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 390 observations beginning 2015-12-28. The marginals were fit using an average of 156 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was all\_bpa\_data.csv.}
