\section{Introduction}

In this brief report, we are describing how we use copulas in a Markov Chain Random Walk to generate power scenarios for the next planning period for multiple sources. This method is part of the \emph{GOSM} software package, which is part of the \emph{prescient} software package itself.\\

All  of the code for implementing this method can be found in the \emph{prescient\_gosm} repository in the directory \emph{prescient\_gosm/markov\_chains/markov\_populator.py} and in the \emph{statdist} repository in the directory \emph{statdist/base\_distribution}.
