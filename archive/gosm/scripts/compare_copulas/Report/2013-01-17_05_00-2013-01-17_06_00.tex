    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 339 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2013-01-17:05:00, 2013-01-17:06:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 347 observations beginning 2012-06-02. The marginals were fit using an average of 139 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was 2012-2013\_BPA\_forecasts\_actuals.csv.}
