\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This report refers to the script "horse\_race\_copulas.py", which can be used to evaluate the performance of different copulas in describing dependences in a given data set. It can be also used to make a horse race between copulas by running it with the same data set but different copulas. After that one can evaluate, which copula fits the given data the best.\\

The \ref{theo}. section explains the theory behind the implemented algorithm, which is shown in section \ref{alg}. In section \ref{res} there are given some results of some experiments, which make clear that the script works.
