    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 299 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2016-07-18:02:00, 2016-07-18:03:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 349 observations beginning 2015-12-28. The marginals were fit using an average of 140 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was all\_bpa\_data.csv.}
