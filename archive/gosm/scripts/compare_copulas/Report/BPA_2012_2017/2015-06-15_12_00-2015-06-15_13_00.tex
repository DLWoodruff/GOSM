    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 870 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2015-06-15:12:00, 2015-06-15:13:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 1504 observations beginning 2012-06-02. The marginals were fit using an average of 603 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was bpa\_wind\_forecasts\_actuals\_2012\_2017.csv.}
