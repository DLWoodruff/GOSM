    \caption{Wasserstein distances for 333 observations of pairs of BPA wind forecast errors beginning 2020-02-03:08:00, 2020-02-03:09:00. The copulas were fit  using an average of 199 observations beginning 2020-01-01. The marginals were fit using an average of 82 observations of respective hours (i.e. the  marginals for the two hours were computed separately) with a MW segmentation filter for the marginals of 0.4. The data file used was 122\_WIND\_1\_forecasts\_actuals.csv.}
